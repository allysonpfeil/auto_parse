# auto_parse
parse through a folder of files for specific words

While CTRL + F is a great tool to find specific words or phrases, this becomes impractical when there are hundreds of files to sort through. This script will:
  1) iterate through a folder of word docs or other text files
  2) parse for specific words or phrases (keywords)
  3) print the file name and which keyword(s) were found. if there were none, it will print the file name and "none of the         keywords were found."

I like using this script to help digest large amounts of data, most commonly from hundreds of word docs on prodecures.
